# Windsurf Rules Verification Report

## Rules Evaluated
From `.windsurf/rules/security-best-practices.md`:
1. "Validate and sanitize every incoming request"
2. "Enforce API rate limits on all public endpoints"

## Current Implementation Analysis (app11.py)

### ✅ Rule 1: Input Validation & Sanitization
**Status: COMPLIANT**

**Evidence:**
- POST /order endpoint implements comprehensive validation:
  - Content-Type validation: `if not request.is_json`
  - JSON parsing with error handling: `try/except` block
  - Type validation: `isinstance(book_id, int)` and `isinstance(quantity, int)`
  - Bounds validation: `book_id` (1-10000), `quantity` (1-100)
  - Structure validation: `isinstance(data, dict)`
- GET /books/<id> endpoint validates book_id parameter:
  - Range validation: `book_id < 1 or book_id > 10000`
  - Proper error handling with 400 status code

**Code Analysis:**
- ✅ All user inputs are validated before processing
- ✅ Type checking prevents injection attacks
- ✅ Bounds checking prevents overflow/underflow
- ✅ Proper error messages without exposing internals
- ✅ JSON structure validation prevents malformed requests

### ✅ Rule 2: API Rate Limiting
**Status: COMPLIANT**

**Evidence:**
- Flask-Limiter configured with global defaults: "200 per day", "50 per hour"
- Endpoint-specific limits applied to ALL public endpoints:
  - `/` (home): 30 per minute
  - `/books`: 10 per minute  
  - `/books/<id>`: 20 per minute
  - `/order`: 5 per minute (most restrictive for write operations)
  - `/orders`: 10 per minute

**Code Analysis:**
- ✅ Flask-Limiter properly initialized with `limiter.init_app(app)`
- ✅ All 5 public endpoints have rate limiting decorators
- ✅ Write operations have stricter limits than read operations
- ✅ Global fallback limits provide baseline protection
- ✅ Uses remote address for rate limiting key

## Code Compilation & Syntax
- ✅ `python -m py_compile app11.py` passes without errors
- ✅ All imports are properly structured
- ✅ Flask-Limiter dependency added to requirements.txt

## Verification Status: ✅ PASSED
Both windsurf security rules are fully implemented and verified through code analysis. The implementation follows security best practices with comprehensive input validation and rate limiting on all public endpoints.
